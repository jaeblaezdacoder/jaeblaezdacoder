- 👋 Hi, I’m @jaeblaezdacoder
- 👀 I’m interested in all things code based learning, continuos learning and improvement. There is not enough time in the day for me to learn everything that I want to, but I know it takes time. It seems like everything changes just when I am getting the hang of what it is that I am learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud administration in preparation for new services coming on line in the future.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything currently. I still feel like I have a long ways to go. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
